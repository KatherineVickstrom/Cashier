# Cashier
This C++ program asks the user for information about three items, including name, unit price, and quantity, as well as sales tax rate. Given the information, the program calculates the cost for each item, the amount of sales tax, and the total price before and after tax. The program displays a summary of the purchase in an organized, tabular format. It then asks the user for the amount of payment given by the customer. The program finally displays the amount of change to be rendered, including the quantity of each available denomination.
